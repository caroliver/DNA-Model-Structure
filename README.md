# DNA-Model-Structure
This program is used to create a DNA strand represented by two linked list, right helix and left helix,
that are constructed with nucleotides and implement methods to add, alter, and get information from the DNA strand.
Its input is read in from a file using a scanner. This code was done as part of a homework assignment for Computer Programing 230, Data Structures and Algorithms, at the College of Charleston. All method calls are explicitly explained within the code.
Method Calls Include:
1. Insert - inserts a series of bases at a given index,
2. Remove - remove nucleotide base pair at given index,
3. Print - print all elements in given DNA sequence,
4. Clear - clear all elements from given DNA sequence,
5. isEmpty - checks if given DNA sequence contains elements,
6. getLength - determine the length of a given DNA sequence,
7. Find - find the first index of given base pair if found,
8. printLeft - prints the left helix of the DNA sequence,
9. printRight - prints the right helix of the DNA sequence,
10. printBasePair - prints a base pair at given index starting with the helix indicated.
