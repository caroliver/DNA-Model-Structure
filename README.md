# DNA-Model-Structure
This program is used to create a DNA strand represented by two linked list, right helix and left helix,
that are constructed with nucleotides and implement methods to add, alter, and get information from the DNA strand.
Its input is read in from a file using a scanner. This code was done as part of a homework assignment for Computer Programing 230, Data Structures and Algorithms, at the College of Charleston. All method calls are explicitly explained within the codes comments.
